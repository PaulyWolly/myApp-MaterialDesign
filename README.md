# MyAppMaterialDesign

Angular app (v12) using Angular Material components.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.11.

## First step

Run `npm i` to gather all depenencies.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to the default port - `http://localhost:4200/` or to the new port Angular has set up for you in the event port 4200 is not available (being used). The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component <component-name>` or the shortcut: `ng g c <component-name>` to generate a new component. 

You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`. See Angular Schematics for info on shortcuts using `ng generate -or- ng g`. 

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
